1. `\c dbname` to connect to a database after entering psql.
2. `CREATE db_name;` -- to create a db
3. If we want the DB name in caps then we must `CREATE DATABASE "COE_module";` ,else the db created would be `coe_module`.
4. To delete all the rows from the table `DELETE FROM faculty_table`.
5. When you define a column as `SERIAL`, PostgreSQL automatically creates a sequence and uses `nextval()` for that column.
