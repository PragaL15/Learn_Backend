## Why do we need logger to monitor our server?

- Storing **backend server logs** in your system provides **critical value** for several reasons. Below are some of the key benefits:

### **1. Troubleshooting and Debugging üîß**
Logs act as the **primary source of truth** when things go wrong. If the server encounters an error, a crash, or unexpected behavior:
- **Error details** like error messages, stack traces, and request paths help pinpoint the root cause.
- You can identify **patterns** of failure, like recurrent issues or timeouts, and act to fix them.

### **2. Performance Monitoring üìà**
Backend logs provide insights into how the system is performing:
- **Request logs** can track response times, request counts, or processing delays, helping identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Database queries** or slow queries logged can help optimize performance.

### **3. Security Monitoring üõ°Ô∏è**
Logs are essential for monitoring security events:
- **Authentication failures** and **unauthorized access attempts** can be logged to detect potential **security breaches**.
- **Suspicious activity** (e.g., brute-force attacks or unusual IP addresses) can be flagged based on the log data.

### **4. Auditing and Accountability üìú**
Logs create an **audit trail** that records:
- Who accessed the system and when.
- What actions were performed, such as data modifications or deletions.
- This is crucial for **compliance** with industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) or **internal accountability**.

### **5. Compliance and Legal Reasons ‚öñÔ∏è**
Certain industries require **logs** to be retained for **compliance purposes**:
- **Financial transactions**, **personal data access**, and **critical operations** need to be logged and stored securely.
- These logs help prove **compliance with regulations** if questioned.

### **6. System Health Monitoring ü©∫**
Logs are key to monitoring the overall health of the system:
- **Warnings** or **critical errors** logged can notify you if a component (e.g., database, file storage, third-party API) is failing.
- **Server resource usage** (CPU, memory, disk usage) can also be tracked.

### **7. Root Cause Analysis üîç**
When there's an incident (like downtime or data inconsistency), logs allow you to:
- Conduct **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** to understand what happened and prevent future occurrences.
- Investigate logs **back in time** to see the sequence of events leading up to an issue.

### **8. User Behavior Tracking üîç**
For applications with user accounts, logs provide insights into:
- **User activities**, such as login attempts, purchases, or interactions with key features.
- Can also assist with **user-specific debugging** or understanding usage patterns to improve UX.

### **9. Automation and Alerts ‚ö°**
By logging important events, you can set up **automated alerts**:
- **Threshold-based alerts** for high response times, error rates, or specific events (like database downtime).
- Alerts can trigger actions like **auto-scaling**, system restarts, or notifications to the team.

### **10. Data for Optimizations and Future Improvements üöÄ**
Logs can highlight **areas for improvement**:
- Identify frequently used features or paths that can be optimized for better performance.
- Spot recurrent errors that need fixing and understand how they impact user experience.

## How the custom logger file is unique and why do we need to prefer it?

```go
logFile, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error opening log file: %v", err)
}
logger := log.New(logFile, "CUSTOM: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
logger.Println("This is a custom log message")
```
 - Using this log storage we can retrieve the logs from past which is not possible while using the `rotation file` and  Can define timestamp format, log levels, and file information.

### Use mutex for handling the multiple users conflict during scaling application.
